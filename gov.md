## **Introduction**
The Canadian government is made up of three parts: the executive branch (led by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet), the legislative branch (including the House of Commons and the Senate), and the judicial branch (comprised of different courts). The government's main job is to make decisions and set policies for the country. They provide services like healthcare and education, collect taxes, manage the economy, and keep the country safe. In Canada, we have a democracy where people elect their leaders and have a say in how the country is run. The government's goal is to serve the people and make decisions that benefit everyone.
