# ***Nota-Set***
## **Unit Information**

This is Nota-Set, where notes will be accessible in just a minute, unless you are needing to redownload these notes.    
The final stage of Webification Switchover is about to get underway. In just a few moments, we will be sunsetting the need for downloading these notes, and all remaining notes, forever, and turning on the last of the new Landing Channels for people to access. This will mean that some systems may be affected, and you will need to reload the previous page tomorrow. Web-based viewers are not affected.

If you or someone you know have any questions, or need help with switching over to a web-accessible service, contact Hyperion University at universityhyperion@gmail.com.

Nota-Set has seen a lot of additions since the start of the original v0.1.1 standard. From the entirety of Pre-Calculus 11, the introduction of the World Wars, and the Cold War to name a few. The movement to a Web-based service will allow for a newer audience to access this growing database of knowledge and services. And that means from the 30 Jun, 2023, the introduction of NKMNT's design language.

Now though, we enter a new Nota-Set milestone, as this becomes a fully Web-based Nota-Set system. From all of us at Hyperion University and the **FEWP** team, good night and goodbye.
