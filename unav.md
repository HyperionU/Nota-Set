If you are seeing this, it probably means that the section you want to access is currently being switched over to Zero Markdown. As a result, many of the links have been adjusted. 

During this time, please use the dedicated links. 

We apologise for the inconvenience, but this work is a necessary part of the process of switching away from Markdown to HTML.

## Introduction
Nota-Set is Changing, and the countdown has begun. Throughout, Nota-Set is switching from Markdown to HTML for its online connections by June 2024. Nota-Set has changed dramatically in the past few years, with its most recent incarnation arriving in June 2023. Change can be confusing, and sometimes scary, but NoMD is here to help.

## What is NoMD?
The Zero Markdown Project (NoMD, /'nəʊ.mæd/) is the independent team at Hyperion University leading the switch to HTML, and they are here to help. NoMD was set up by the Faculties at Hyperion, that being Decrypt Maths (DCM), the Institute of Applied Sciences (IAS), Hyperion College of Engineering (HCE), as well as the Hyperion University Institute of Technology (HUIT) and HIAS (Hyperion Institute of Applied Sciences).

## What Makes HTML Different?
HTML gives all of the features of Markdown as standard. It also includes easier styling via CSS, Interactive elements through JS as well as more features like website formatting, easily following the design language of NKMNT neo, as it becomes standard over the following year. HTML links also only work well with other HTML pages. It's only possible to keep Nota-Set working reliably by switching away from the existing Markdown pages. It also means that coherency can be made between the standard Hyperion University website and Nota-Set.

## When is Switchover Happening?
Pre-Calculus 12 would be the first to switch over to HTML, with Calculus getting HTML as standard. All subjects of Nota-Set would switch at different times. This list will show when each section will switch:

- Calculus 12 - Standard
- Political Studies - Standard
1. [Transformations](pc12/trans.html) & [Polynomials](pc12/poly.html) (PC12) **(Complete)**
2. Government & Quadratics (SS10 & PC11) **(Complete)**
3. 1914-1938 (SS10) **(Complete)**
4. Rationals & Radicals (PC11) **(Complete)**
5. WWII & Trigonometry (SS10 & PC11) **(Complete)**
6. Cold War (SS10) **(Complete)**
7. [Trigonometric Functions](pc12/trigf.html), [Graphing](pc12/graph.html) and [Trigonometric Identities](pc12/trigi.html) (PC12) **(Complete)**
8. [Exponentials and Rationals](pc12/exp.html), [Logarithms](pc12/log.html) and [Function Operations](pc12/comp.html) (PC12) **(In Progress)**
9. Landing Page Switchover

## How Conversion Works
If you download Nota-Set, there should be no issue. You don't need to do anything. Each Stage will keep the original Markdown files as fallbacks, but at the end, to mark the final shift, the official Landing page will be switched over to HTML as well. All markdown files will be added to an archive folder, and promptly deleted. Newer options are becoming available all the time. For more information about them, contact Hyperion University.

## What help is Available?
The NoMD team are working on an official notice page offering practical assistance to help most make the switch on their own, and where you can check the current options for each section. Notices will be posted on the page at least one week prior to switchover for each section.
