## Pre-Calculus 12 - <i class="fa-solid fa-superscript"></i> Exponential and Rational Functions
## **Introduction**

**Exponential Functions** have the form $f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ is a constant and $b$ is the base. These functions grow or decay exponentially. \
**Rational Functions**, on the other hand, are ratios of polynomials, such as $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$. They have applications in modeling real-world phenomena and are important in calculus.
