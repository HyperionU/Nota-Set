## **Introduction**
World War II was a global conflict that took place from 1939 to 1945. It started when Germany invaded Poland, and Canada, alongside other countries like Britain and France, joined the fight against Germany. Canadian soldiers played important roles in battles like the Battle of Britain and the D-Day invasion of Normandy.

Back in Canada, the war brought changes to the economy and society. Industries produced weapons and supplies, and women took on new roles in the workforce. The war also led to increased immigration to Canada.

The war finally ended in 1945 when Germany and Japan surrendered. It had a profound impact, causing significant loss of life and the establishment of the United Nations to promote peace.

In Canada, World War II is remembered for the bravery and sacrifices of Canadian soldiers and civilians, shaping the country's commitment to peace and democracy.
