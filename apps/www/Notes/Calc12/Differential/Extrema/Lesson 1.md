# Lesson 1: Intercepts and Zeros

---

<!--paginate: true-->

## Intro 

* Throughout this unit, we'll be looking at various descriptive elements of functions which enable us to develop a better visual understanding of the functions.
* You should be very familiar with the intercepts or zeros of a function.
* Let's review by re-examining intercepts.

---

## $y$-intercepts

* The $y$-intercept is the point when the function crosses the $y$-axis. 
* By definition, this is when $x = 0$.
* As such, all $y$-intercepts can be written as $(0,y)$.
* To find them, we substitute 0 into the function in place of $x$.

---

## Example 1

1. Find the $y$-intercept of $y = 4x^2 - 2x - 5$
    * $y = 4(0)^2 - 2(0) - 5$
    * $y = -5$
    * $y$-intercept: $(0, -5)$

---

## Example 2

1. Find the $y$-intercept of $y = \frac{3x^2 - 1}{5x + 7}$
    * $y = \frac{3(0)^2 - 1}{5(0) + 7}$
    * $y = -\frac{1}{7}$
    * $y$-intercept: $(0, -\frac{1}{7})$

---

## $x$-intercepts

* The $x$-intercepts correspond to the zeros of the function.
* Unlike the $y$-intercept, there may be more than one $x$-intercept.
* In fact, as you know, polynomials of degree $n$ can have up to as many as $n$ $x$-intercepts.
* To find the $x$-intercepts, we substitute 0 for $y$.

---

## Example 1

1. Find the $x$-intercepts of $y = x^2 - 2x - 15$
    * $x^2 - 2x - 15 = 0$
    * $(x + 3)(x - 5) = 0$
    * $x = 5, -3$

---

## Example 2

2. Find the $x$-intercepts of $y = 2x^2 + 5x - 1$
    * $2x^2 + 5x - 1 = 0$
    * We'll have to use the quadratic formula.
    * $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)}$
    * $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 8}}{4}$
    * $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{33}}{4}$
    * $x = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{33}}{4}, \frac{-5 - \sqrt{33}}{4}$

---

## Example 3

3. Find the $x$ and $y$-intercepts of $y = 2x^2 - 11x + 5$
    * $y$-intercept
        * $y = 2(0)^2 - 11(0) + 5$
        * $y = 5$
    * $x$-intercepts
        * $2x^2 - 11x + 5 = 0$
        * $(2x - 1)(x - 5) = 0$
        * $2x - 1 = 0$, $x - 5 = 0$
        * $x = 5, \frac{1}{2}$

---

## Example 4

4. Find the $x$ and $y$-intercepts of $y = 2 \cos x$, where $x \in [-\pi, \pi]$
    * $y$-intercept
        * $y = 2\cos 0$
        * $y = 2$
    * $x$-intercepts
        * $2 \cos x = 0$
        * $\cos x = 0$
        * $x = \pm \frac{\pi}{2}$

---

## Example 5

5. Find the $x$ and $y$-intercepts of $y = 2 \cos x - 1$, where $x \in [0, 2\pi]$
    * $y$-intercept
        * $y = 2\cos 0 - 1$
        * $y = 1$
    * $x$-intercepts
        * $2 \cos x - 1 = 0$
        * $\cos x = \frac{1}{2}$
        * $x = \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{5\pi}{3}$

---

## Exercise for Readers

* Find the $x$ and $y$-intercepts of the following:
    * $y = 2x - 6$
    * $y = x^2 - x$
    * $y = 3x^2 - 10x - 8$
    * $y = 3 \sin x$, $x \in [0, \pi]$
    * $y = \frac{4x^2 - x}{3x - 7}$
    * $y = 2x^2 - 3x - 7$
