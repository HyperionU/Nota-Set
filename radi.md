## **Introduction**

In grade 11, you'll come across radical expressions and equations. Radical expressions involve the square root symbol (√) and finding the square root of a number. For example, √9 is 3 because 3 multiplied by itself equals 9.

Radical equations are equations that contain radical expressions. The goal is to find the value that makes the equation true. To solve a radical equation, you need to isolate the radical expression and then square both sides of the equation to remove the square root symbol.

For example, if you have the equation √x = 4, you square both sides to get rid of the square root. This results in x = 16, meaning that the value of x that satisfies the equation is 16.

Remember to practice solving different types of radical equations to become more comfortable with them.
