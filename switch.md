# ***Nota-Set***
## **Unit Information**
It's an exciting time for all of us here at Hyperion University, as in a few moments, we will be making the switch over to a web-accessible service. Shortly, we will be switching on the new Pre-Calculus channels, bypassing the need to access Nota-Set via multiple downloads, permanently.     
We hope you have switched over to your web-accessible services now, so you can get the same wonderful easy to access notes as always. 
All remaining notes & programming will become web-accessible on 29 Jun, with a fully accessible web-based service by 30 Jun. 
If you or someone you know have any questions, or need help with switching over to a web-accessible service, contact Hyperion University at universityhyperion@gmail.com.

So now, in just a few moments, our web-accessible service is about to be switched on, and all non-web-accessible users should switch over to their web-based service to continue using Nota-Set. If you at present use a web-based service, you won't need to do anything. If not, you may need to adjust your web-accessible service tomorrow, and when the system is officially fully up and running on the 30 Jun. After *169* days, this is where Nota-Set says goodbye, to downloading.
