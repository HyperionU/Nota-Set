## Pre-Calculus 11 - <i class="fa-solid fa-superscript"></i> Quadratic Functions
## **Introduction**

Quadratic functions involve a variable squared, represented by an equation of the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. They create a curved line called a parabola when graphed. The coefficient 'a' determines whether the parabola opens upward or downward. The constants 'b' and 'c' affect the position of the parabola. Quadratic functions are used to describe real-life situations and solve problems involving maximum or minimum values. They help us understand and analyze various phenomena in fields like physics, business, and engineering.
