# Lesson 3: PM Trudeau (1979-1984)

---

## Clark's Collapse

* 1979: an election year, people wanted change.
* Led by Joe Clark, a Conservative minority gov't was elected.
* But, Clark tried a bold budget to raise taxes and cut spending.
* The budget was defeated. Clark's gov't collapsed after only 9 months.

## Trudeau's Return

* 1980: Trudeau returned with a majority gov't. The National Energy Program (NEP) was introduced.
* The NEP promoted oil self-sufficiency & 50% Canadian ownership by 1990.
* It established a Crown Corporation: Petro-Canada (*Yep, Petro-Canada was formerly owned by the gov't. I didn't believe it at first as well.*)
* It increased taxes on exports & set price controls on oil prices.

## The NEP

* There was one problem: The NEP benefited central Canada, but hurt western Canada. (*You know, where all the Canadian oil comes from?*)
* Trudeau deeply angered and alienated western Canada.
