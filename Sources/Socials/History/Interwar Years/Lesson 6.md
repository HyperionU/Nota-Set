# Lesson 6: Road to War

---

## Appeasement

* Sudden rise of dictatorships was a concern, little could be done
* Citizens scared to speak out, as secret police and informers result in a person's "disappearance"
* All countries were economically weak, not prepared to fight a war.
* Countries interested in managing peace, rather than taking stands.

## 1935: Appeasement

* Italy invades **Abyssinia** (modern day Ethiopia)
* League of Nations imposes sanctions, but not on oil
* Not all members supported sanctions
* Later, the League suggests a plan that gives 2/3 of Abyssinia to Italy.
* Secretly Britain & France agree: let Italy have Abyssinia
* A **major** failure of the league.
* Indication to Hitler that the world wasn't ready to oppose him!
