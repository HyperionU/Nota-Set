# Lesson 0: Outline

## What are transformations?

* **Graph Transformations** involve modifying the appearance of a function's graph. 
* Common transformations include *translating* the graph horizontally or vertically (1), *stretching or compressing* it (3), *reflecting* it across the x-axis or y-axis (2), and taking its *inverse* (5). 
* These transformations help visualize how changes in the function's equation affect its graph.

## Composition of Transformations

* Since these transformations modify the appearance of the graph, we can combine them to adjust functions more specifically.
* This is *composition*, and when we get to *mapping notation*, you will see certain maps with compositions, and without.
