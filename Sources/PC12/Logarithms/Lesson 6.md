# Lesson 6: Applications

## Types of Applications

* An exponential function is in the form $f(x) = A \cdot c^x$, where $A$ is a constant and $c > 0$.
* There are two types we will consider.
* Type I: $c$ is a % (Compound Interest)
* Type II: Growth and Decay (Double, Triple and Half-life)

---

## Type I: Compound Interest

* $A = P(1 + r)^t$ compounded annually or % increase.
* $A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$ compounded n times / year.
* $A = P(1 - r)^t$ % decrease.
* *Note: We're only focusing on the discrete case.*
