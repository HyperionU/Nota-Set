# Lesson 1: Solving Exponential Equations

## On Exponents

You should be familiar with powers of integers:

$2^n = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \cdots$
$3^n = 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, \cdots$
$4^n = 4, 16, 64, 256, \cdots$
$5^n = 5, 25, 125, 625, \cdots$
$6^n = 6, 36, 216, \cdots$

## Exponent Rules

<div class = "columns">
<span>

* Identity
    * $x^0 = 1$
* Product
    * $x^m \cdot x^n = x^{m + n}$
* Quotient
    * $\frac{x^m}{x^n} = x^{m - n}$
* Power
    * $(x^m)^n = x^{mn}$
* Distributive Product
    * $(xy)^m = x^m y^m$

</span>
<span>

* Distributive Quotient
    * $(\frac{x}{y})^m = \frac{x^m}{y^m}$
* Inverse
    * $x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}$
* Reciprocal
    * $(\frac{x}{y})^{-n} = (\frac{y}{x})^n$
* Fractional
    * $x^\frac{m}{n} = \sqrt[n]{x^m} = (\sqrt[n]{x})^m$

## On Exponent Rules

* They all deal with multiplication and division.
* Must have **SAME** base to combine
* Fractional Exponents are radicals in disguise.
* Quite often, you'll convert radicals to rational exponents instead

## Solving Exponential Equations

Strategy: if $b^x = b^y, x = y$

When Solving:
* Get the same base
* set exponents equal to each other

1. $8^{3x - 2} = 16^{x + 1}$
    * $(2^3)^{3x - 2} = (2^4)^{x + 1}$
    * $2^{9x - 6} = 2^{4x + 4}$
    * $9x - 6 = 4x + 4$
    * $5x = 10, x = 2$

## Solving Exponentials

2. $27^{x + 3} = (\frac{1}{9})^{2x - 5}$
