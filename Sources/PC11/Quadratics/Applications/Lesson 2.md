## Lesson 2: Applications, Part 2

---

## Example 1: Dimensions

* The area of a rectangular table is $45\text{ ft}^2$. The length is $4\text{ ft}$ more than the width. What are the dimensions of the table?
1) Define Variables:
    * $A=\text{area}$, $\ell=\text{length}$, $w=\text{width}$.
2) Write the formula for the situation
    * $A=\ell w$
3) Fill in the formula
    * What do we know?
        * $A=45,\ell=4+w$

## Solving Example 1, Part 1

* Work with new equation to determine factors: $45=(w+4)w$ 
    * $w^2+4w-45=0$
* We have many tools we can use, *which one?*
    * Graph
    * Square-Root Principle
    * Factoring
    * Quadratic Formula
* How about *factoring?*
