## **Introduction**

A quadratic equation has a variable squared (like $x^2$) and is written in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. We solve quadratic equations to find the values of 'x' that make the equation true. We can solve quadratic equations using methods like factoring, completing the square, the square root principle, or the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are known numbers from the equation.
The discriminant ($\Delta, b^2 - 4ac$) tells us about the solutions:
* If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions.
* If it's zero, there is one real solution.
* If it's negative, there are no real solutions, only complex solutions.

Quadratic equations are used in math, science, and engineering to solve various problems and find important points on graphs.
