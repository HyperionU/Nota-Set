## Pre-Calculus 11 - <i class="fa-solid fa-superscript"></i> Quadratics
## **Introduction**

Quadratics are equations that involve a variable raised to the power of 2. They have three parts: "a," "b," and "c." "a" determines how steep or flat the curve is, "b" shifts the curve horizontally, and "c" affects its vertical position. By solving quadratics, we find values for the variable that make the equation true. These equations are used in areas like physics and engineering to solve problems involving motion and relationships.
