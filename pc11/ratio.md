## Pre-Calculus 11 - Rationals
## **Introduction**

Rational expressions are fractions that have variables in them. They are written like $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are expressions with variables and coefficients. The denominator cannot be zero.

Rational equations are equations that have these fractions in them. To solve a rational equation, you find the values of the variable that make the equation true.

In simple terms, rational expressions and equations involve fractions with variables. We use them in algebra to solve problems related to rates, proportions, and ratios in real-life situations.
