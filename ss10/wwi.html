                World War I, also known as the Great War, was a major conflict that took place from 1914 to 1918. Canada, as part of the British Empire, joined the war when Britain declared war on Germany. Many Canadians volunteered to fight, believing it was their duty to defend the British Empire.<br>
                Canadian soldiers participated in significant battles like Ypres, the Somme, and Vimy Ridge. The war was characterized by harsh trench warfare and resulted in heavy casualties. Canadians achieved a notable victory at Vimy Ridge in 1917, but the cost in lives was high.<br>
                Life on the front lines was challenging and dangerous, with soldiers facing constant shelling and diseases. The war had a profound impact on Canada, shaping its identity and leading to social changes such as increased rights for women.<br>
                The war ended in 1918 when Germany surrendered, and the armistice was signed on November 11. World War I is remembered in Canada as a time of sacrifice and bravery. It had a lasting impact on the nation and is an important part of its history.

                The causes of World War I, which began in 1914, are commonly attributed to a complex web of factors, notably <strong>Nationalism.</strong><br>
                Intense national pride and desires for independence among ethnic groups within empires (such as the Slavs in the Balkans) contributed to an environment ripe for conflict.<br>
                Nationalism fueled an environment of competition and distrust among countries, contributing to militarism, the formation of alliances, and imperialism, all of which set the stage for World War I.<br>

                The early weeks of the war were marked by rapid troop movements and major battles, as both sides attempted to gain an advantage.<br> 
                However, the initial expectation of a short conflict quickly faded as both sides dug in for a prolonged and grueling war of attrition, marked by trench warfare on the Western Front.
