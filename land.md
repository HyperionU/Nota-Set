## **FAQs**

### **What is the FEWP?**
The First Edition Webification Project (**FEWP**, /fjʉ́wp'/) continues on the work done to digitize notes to make a central access point for people to access. Their goal is to make Nota-Set fully web accessible for all, eliminating the need to download and redownload previous versions.
### **What Needs to be Done?**
The **FEWP** Team has previously stated that Nota-Set should be a central access point for people to access.
So, what's left is to connect up the remaining 'channels' to switch over to the **FEWP**'s network of Landing Pages.
The work for this will be done in stages, completing by the 30 Jun, 2023 deadline.
### **When Can I Expect the Switchover for a specific unit?**
The system will be switched over, by the **FEWP** team in stages. Here's what to expect for the time of switchover:
1. Interwar Years & WWII 
2. Quadratics (current)
3. Rationals
4. Post-War Canada
5. Radicals
6. Trigonometry
7. Design & Refinement
