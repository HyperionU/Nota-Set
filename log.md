## **Introduction**

**Logarithms** are the inverse operations of exponentiation. The logarithm base $b$ of a number $x$ is denoted as $\log_b(x)$ and represents the exponent to which $b$ must be raised to obtain $x$. Logarithmic functions help solve exponential equations and have applications in various fields, including finance and science.
