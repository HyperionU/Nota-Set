1. **Graph Transformations** involve modifying the appearance of a function's graph. Common transformations include shifting the graph horizontally or vertically, stretching or compressing it, and reflecting it across the x-axis or y-axis. These transformations help visualize how changes in the function's equation affect its graph.
2. **Polynomials** are mathematical expressions with variables raised to non-negative integer powers. They take the form of $(a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0)$, where $(a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0)$ are coefficients. The highest power of $x$ is the degree of the polynomial. Polynomials are essential in algebra and can be used to represent various mathematical relationships.
3. **Trigonometric Functions,** such as sine, cosine, and tangent, relate the angles of a right triangle to the ratios of its sides. These functions are extended to all real numbers and have periodic behavior. Trigonometry is widely used in geometry, physics, and engineering to analyze and model periodic phenomena. **The Unit Circle** is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate system. It is used in trigonometry to define the values of trigonometric functions for all angles. The coordinates of points on the unit circle are directly related to the cosine and sine of the corresponding angles.
4. **Trigonometric Identities** are equations involving trigonometric functions that are true for all values of the variables. Examples include the Pythagorean identities (e.g., $sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1$) and angle-sum and angle-difference identities. These identities are crucial for simplifying expressions and solving trigonometric equations.
5. **Exponential Functions** have the form $f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ is a constant and $b$ is the base. These functions grow or decay exponentially. **Rational Functions**, on the other hand, are ratios of polynomials, such as $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$. They have applications in modeling real-world phenomena and are important in calculus.
6. **Logarithms** are the inverse operations of exponentiation. The logarithm base $b$ of a number $x$ is denoted as $\log_b(x)$ and represents the exponent to which $b$ must be raised to obtain $x$. Logarithmic functions help solve exponential equations and have applications in various fields, including finance and science.
7. **Composition of Functions** involves combining two or more functions to create a new function. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions, their composition is denoted as $(f \circ g)(x)$ or $f(g(x))$. Understanding function composition is crucial for analyzing complex relationships and transformations in mathematics.
