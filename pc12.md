1. [**Graph Transformations**](pc12/trans.html) involve modifying the appearance of a function's graph. Common transformations include shifting the graph horizontally or vertically, stretching or compressing it, and reflecting it across the x-axis or y-axis. These transformations help visualize how changes in the function's equation affect its graph.
2. [**Polynomials**](pc12/poly.html) are mathematical expressions with variables raised to non-negative integer powers. They take the form of $(a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1x + a_0)$, where $(a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0)$ are coefficients. The highest power of $x$ is the degree of the polynomial. Polynomials are essential in algebra and can be used to represent various mathematical relationships.
3. [**Trigonometric Functions**](pc12/trigf.html) such as sine, cosine, and tangent, relate the angles of a right triangle to the ratios of its sides. Trigonometry is widely used in geometry, physics, and engineering to analyze and model periodic phenomena. 
4. [**Graphing Trigonometric Functions**](pc12/graph.html) such as sine, cosine, and tangent, extend the functions to all real numbers. They all have the same periodic behavior. 
5. [**Trigonometric Identities**](pc12/trigi.html) are equations involving trigonometric functions that are true for all values of the variables. Examples include the Pythagorean identities (e.g., $sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1$) and angle-sum and angle-difference identities. These identities are crucial for simplifying expressions and solving trigonometric equations.
6. [**Exponential Functions**](pc12/exp.html) have the form $f(x) = a \cdot b^x$, where $a$ is a constant and $b$ is the base. These functions grow or decay exponentially. **Rational Functions**, on the other hand, are ratios of polynomials, such as $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$. They have applications in modeling real-world phenomena and are important in calculus.
7. [**Logarithms**](pc12/log.md) are the inverse operations of exponentiation. The logarithm base $b$ of a number $x$ is denoted as $\log_b(x)$ and represents the exponent to which $b$ must be raised to obtain $x$. Logarithmic functions help solve exponential equations and have applications in various fields, including finance and science.
8. [**Composition of Functions**](pc12/comp.md) involves combining two or more functions to create a new function. If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions, their composition is denoted as $(f \circ g)(x)$ or $f(g(x))$. Understanding function composition is crucial for analyzing complex relationships and transformations in mathematics.
