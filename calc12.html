                    Calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on understanding rates of change and accumulation. <br>
                    There are two main components: <strong>differential calculus</strong> and <strong>integral calculus</strong>. <br>
                    In <strong>differential calculus</strong>, derivatives measure how a function's output changes concerning its input. <br>
                    Common rules include the power rule, sum/difference rule, product rule, and quotient rule, providing methods to differentiate various types of functions. <br>
                    <strong>Integral calculus</strong> deals with the accumulation of quantities. Integrals, both indefinite and definite, involve finding antiderivatives and calculating accumulated quantities over specified intervals. <br>
                    The <strong>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</strong> establishes a critical link between differentiation and integration, stating that the definite integral of a function is the difference between its antiderivative values at the upper and lower bounds. <br>
                    Calculus is a foundational tool in various fields, enabling the modeling and analysis of dynamic processes, such as motion, growth, and accumulation. 
                    It provides a powerful mathematical framework to understand and solve real-world problems in physics, engineering, economics, and biology.
