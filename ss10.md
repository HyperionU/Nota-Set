## Socials 10 - Canada and The World: 1914 - 
## **Introduction**

The main goal of Social Studies education is to teach students the knowledge and skills they need to be active and informed citizens. It helps them think critically, understand different perspectives, make judgments, and communicate effectively.

By studying historical events, students learn about the people, places, issues, and events that have shaped the world. They also explore various cultures and ways of life, which helps them understand both the differences and similarities between people throughout history and across the globe.

Social Studies teaches students about their place in the world and the connections between humans and the environment. It emphasizes the importance of understanding how different societies are interconnected and how our economic decisions can impact individuals, communities, and even countries.
