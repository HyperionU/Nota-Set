### Introduction

During the period from 1914 to 2000, Canada transitioned from a British colony to an independent nation and played a crucial role in significant global events. 

In World War I and II, Canadian forces fought bravely alongside Britain and its allies. After gaining more independence, Canada became a prominent peacekeeping nation during the Cold War, participating in UN missions worldwide. 
    
The country's cultural impact grew as immigrants from diverse backgrounds settled there. Additionally, Canada experienced economic growth, becoming one of the wealthiest nations globally and contributing significantly to international trade and diplomacy.

### Introduction

Quadratics is about solving equations with squared terms (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), and their graphs are parabolas. 

Rational expressions are fractions with algebraic expressions in the numerator and/or denominator, and solving rational equations involves finding common denominators and checking for extraneous solutions. 

Radicals are square roots (√a) representing the opposite of squaring a number, sometimes resulting in irrational values. 
    
Trigonometry deals with angles and sides of triangles, with primary functions like sine, cosine, and tangent relating angle ratios in right triangles. Trigonometry finds widespread applications in fields like engineering, physics, and navigation.

### [Pre-Calculus 12](pc12.md) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/NoMD_ZM_Compliance-No_Data-grey?logo=adguard)
### Introduction

In grade 12 mathematics, students explore various topics, including graph transformations that modify the appearance of function graphs through shifts, stretches, and reflections. 

Polynomials, algebraic expressions with non-negative integer powers, are fundamental for representing mathematical relationships. 

Trigonometric functions like sine and cosine relate angles in a right triangle to side ratios, while the unit circle facilitates the understanding of these functions for all angles.

Trigonometric identities, such as the Pythagorean identity, play a key role in simplifying expressions.
Exponential functions showcase exponential growth or decay, and rational functions, ratios of polynomials, are vital for modeling real-world phenomena.

Logarithms, the inverse of exponentiation, aid in solving exponential equations. 

Lastly, the composition of functions involves combining two or more functions to create new relationships, fostering a deeper understanding of complex mathematical transformations.

### Introduction

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on understanding rates of change and accumulation. There are two main components: differential calculus and integral calculus.

In differential calculus, derivatives measure how a function's output changes concerning its input. Notations like 
$f'(x)$ or $\frac{df}{dx}$ represent derivatives. Common rules include the power rule, sum/difference rule, product rule, and quotient rule, providing methods to differentiate various types of functions.

Integral calculus deals with the accumulation of quantities. Integrals, both indefinite ($∫f(x)dx$) and definite ($∫_a^bf(x)dx$), involve finding antiderivatives and calculating accumulated quantities over specified intervals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes a critical link between differentiation and integration, stating that the definite integral of a function is the difference between its antiderivative values at the upper and lower bounds.

Calculus is a foundational tool in various fields, enabling the modeling and analysis of dynamic processes, such as motion, growth, and accumulation. It provides a powerful mathematical framework to understand and solve real-world problems in physics, engineering, economics, and biology.
