### Introduction

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on understanding rates of change and accumulation. There are two main components: differential calculus and integral calculus.

In differential calculus, derivatives measure how a function's output changes concerning its input. Notations like 
$f'(x)$ or $\frac{df}{dx}$ represent derivatives. Common rules include the power rule, sum/difference rule, product rule, and quotient rule, providing methods to differentiate various types of functions.

Integral calculus deals with the accumulation of quantities. Integrals, both indefinite ($∫f(x)dx$) and definite ($∫_a^bf(x)dx$), involve finding antiderivatives and calculating accumulated quantities over specified intervals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes a critical link between differentiation and integration, stating that the definite integral of a function is the difference between its antiderivative values at the upper and lower bounds.

Calculus is a foundational tool in various fields, enabling the modeling and analysis of dynamic processes, such as motion, growth, and accumulation. It provides a powerful mathematical framework to understand and solve real-world problems in physics, engineering, economics, and biology.
