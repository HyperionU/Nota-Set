    ### Introduction

    Quadratics is about solving equations with squared terms (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), and their graphs are parabolas. 

    Rational expressions are fractions with algebraic expressions in the numerator and/or denominator, and solving rational equations involves finding common denominators and checking for extraneous solutions. 

    Radicals are square roots (âˆša) representing the opposite of squaring a number, sometimes resulting in irrational values. 
    
    Trigonometry deals with angles and sides of triangles, with primary functions like sine, cosine, and tangent relating angle ratios in right triangles. Trigonometry finds widespread applications in fields like engineering, physics, and navigation.
